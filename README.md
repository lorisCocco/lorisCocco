Hi, I'm @lorisCocco, a web developper currently studying for a bachelor's degree and aiming to continue on a master.
I began learning with PHP and JS, and i was employed as a full stack developper for the creation of a website using Laravel.
I'm actually working my way through the Java MOOC by the Helsinki University where i'm learning Java.
I'm currently searching for an internship for a bachelor while studying at EPSI, and if possible continue up to a master's degree.
